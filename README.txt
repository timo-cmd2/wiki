ThermalStorm: A strong-armoured parasitic, self-spreading worm, featuring the use of NetBIOS/NetBUS/Sub Seven backdoor and an own polymorphic engine. 

Payload: on every 31st of every month, do a SYNFLOOD via open port-scans to randomly choosen hosts xD. 

Ideas: 
- Use of Bluekeep rdp injection
- decrease the worm body for a better polymorphism style
- include local copies of its win10 driver for ring0 residence

Thanks and regards to all the aWes0me devs at 29/A, especially for Mental Driller from Metaph0r!
